# Modal window

Hey, I just built my first package and there is the way to use my modal from npm.

## https://www.npmjs.com/package/modal-weather




## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
 npm i modal-weather

 use the link to import the modal in your component :

 import Modal from 'modal-weather/dist/components/modal'

 there is 4 params inside the modal to use:

 className = {display the classname you want, i give a css file with the classname to
 to have a first basic modal}

 style = {inline style if you want to use it in the component}
  
 text = 'use string to put the message you want to display in the modal'
 close = {the function you want to put in the modal, generally i use useState to display it}
```
    
## Documentation

The css file can be import from that way :





```javascript
import ModalCSS from 'modal-weather/dist/components/styles/modal.css'

```

there is a basic style for the modal centered and background opacity.
